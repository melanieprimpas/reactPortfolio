      <p>
          My name is Melanie and I am a 25 year old girl from the North shore of Boston, Massachusetts.
          I have three years of experience working as a mechanical engineer for the Portsmouth Naval 
          Shipyard. I graduated summa cum laude at Roger Williams University in 2017 with a bachelors 
          degree in Engineering and a specialization in Mechanaical Engineering.

          In my free time I enjoy going for walks outside, going to the beach, hiking and exploring new areas. 
          I also enjoy spending time with my family, cooking, reading, and attending spin classes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some important goals for me are to widen my skillset in software development and coding which I hope 
          to accomplish in the University of New Hampshire Coding Boot Camp.
